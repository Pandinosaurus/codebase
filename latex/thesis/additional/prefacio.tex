\epigraph{\textit{``Well, I feel bad to lose you, but we did some nice work when we were together. Always remember that we are a lucky lot. We explore nature looking for her secret laws that govern our lives. [...] Our thirst is to uncover the secrets. That is exciting. Each finding we make changes the way people feel about their world. You must continue that. The human brain is an amazing thing. [...] Our brains are designed to  think. They are thinking machines. The more you imagine, the more you enjoy. Never be followers. They are next to dead bodies. All I want you to do is to continue challenging life.''}}{--- \textup{Thrishantha Nanayakkara in \textit{Devi}}}

%Imagine a circle that contains all of human knowledge:

%\end{center}
%By the time you finish elementary school, you know a little:
%\begin{center}
%	\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{PhDKnowledge002.jpg}
%\end{center}
%By the time you finish high school, you know a bit more:
%\begin{center}
%	\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{PhDKnowledge003.jpg}
%\end{center}
%With a bachelor's degree, you gain a specialty:
%\begin{center}
%	\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{PhDKnowledge004.jpg}
%\end{center}
%A master's degree deepens that specialty:
%\begin{center}
%	\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{PhDKnowledge005.jpg}
%\end{center}
%Reading research papers takes you to the edge of human knowledge:
%\begin{center}
%	\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{PhDKnowledge006.jpg}
%\end{center}
%Once you're at the boundary, you focus:
%\begin{center}
%	\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{PhDKnowledge007.jpg}
%\end{center}
%You push at the boundary for a few years:
%\begin{center}
%	\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{PhDKnowledge008.jpg}
%\end{center}
%Until one day, the boundary gives way:
%\begin{center}
%	\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{PhDKnowledge009.jpg}
%\end{center}
%And, that dent you've made is called a Ph.D.:
%\begin{center}
%	\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{PhDKnowledge010.jpg}
%\end{center}
%Of course, the world looks different to you now:
%\begin{center}
%	\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{PhDKnowledge011.jpg}
%\end{center}
%So, don't forget the bigger picture:

%Keep pushing \citep{mightphd}.
